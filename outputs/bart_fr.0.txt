And so what if it is a rebound relationship for both of you?
Good luck in your search for the one!
Why does everyone seem to want someone that they cannot have and know that they should not want?
Do you like to argue and fight?
If you are set on that, that is the way to go!
My ex-boyfriend of three years was unfaithful.
Work at it, but do not let him keep you locked up at home.
Other than those two things, just ask him once in awhile.
Men get bored and tire faster than women do.
She is strong, loving, and most importantly, wasn't as happy as she thought she was.
It is one way of saying that I do not like you.
King had a song about this called "Only Your Mother Loves You" and it might be jiving too.
He loves you, too, girl. Time will tell.
He wants me to change how I look.
I know I have someone to come home to.
Did you use Google because I want to have sex, but you have to be careful.
Do you want all of your friends to be with you forever?
It does not mean that you are promiscuous.
I am going to a club and dancing.
Do not go anywhere you went with him or her.
They are a lot of fun. There is plenty to do.
It depends on when you are ready.
Stay 100 miles away from this man.
Be prepared because if it happens once, it can happen again.
I am looking for the girl who wants to spend time with me.
Not until he finds another girlfriend.
My wife says, "We do not wear that."
If you are asking, then you should end the relationship and open yourself up to other options.
Why do homosexuals want to get married?
(Saying sorry to him without committing a mistake is humilation to yourself, and do not ever get weak!)
Do you have to rush your choice?
They both do not respect your feelings.
No seriously, think about how many cocky girls are out there.
She is too afraid to ask him out.
Get a grip, how can you love someone that you do not even communicate with?
I would ask you out, but I live in Oregon and have no idea where you live.
They have never performed before, and it doubles the pleasure!
I will probably go and see one.
I wish you the best of luck, but I am glad that I have brown hair!
Send me an email at honorarius@yahoo.com and I will tell you.
It is simply a challenge.
I am a girl, so I will help you out.
Do not tell them, but let them find out once you are in bed with her.
If I would have kept my last name, it is just a freakin name.
I hardly ever see him in school either, usually I see him at my brother's basketball games.
He is telling that to some girls as well. He is a womanizer.
Drop his bottom, there are plenty of fish in the sea of amore.
I know because I am just like your wife.
When she calls, text her back.
No way, I am 5'4" and he is 6'2".
Don't you know the number one rule is to trust no one?
We have tried breaking up a couple of times, but it never happens.
Some because they are thin and skinny, and nowadays anorexic girls are a turn on.
If you have a penis, then it is no problem. You just have to perform oral sex on her.
In that case, take some defense classes.
I just ended a three year relationship with my baby's father.
What happened when the politician took Viagra?
Hello, my name is xxxxxx. I have been working for me for years.
I can say that women are complicated.
We like soft approaches and a little bit of chasing.
You would be surprised by the type of people that go to them.
It is very fun and enjoyable, especially when you meet each other after texting for a few months.
I am in New York City and I will help you out if you are around.
It sounds strange, but it worked in about three to five days for me!
Do not worry, I am not working with much either.
Why does it matter what they think? If they do not get along, do not spend time together.
If he is, then you have a good man.
If he likes you, you will know.
I suppose it is normal, but I would just move on.
The rest is easy from there.
I like any guy that is funny.
Girl, only you can decide on this.
Why do you ask this question?
You should tell everyone because you think it is right.
A ten year age difference is nice.
If he still does not like you, then move on.
I see him every week in school, but I cannot talk to him.
Because they feel insecure with less educated men.
For one thing, if it does not work out, there goes your job.
I hope to God it does not ever pass.
Only the ones that are not worth your time.
Of course, it is all about looks.
You guys do not have any reason to hate each other.
If you do not, you will always wonder.
Some people choose not to because of their religion, but others do not.
Give it a chance. If you break up with them, it would be harder to be friends.
I wish you the best of luck.
Men who were not ready to commit.
This is a big day in both of your lives, it should not be done quickly and without thought.
I am 55 years old and still live at home with my mother, what is wrong with that?
One man is willing to move 21 hours and 1,400 miles just to be with me.
I must not be ugly enough.
That is fine, I am a giver.
Well, it depends on women what they want.
Remember, it takes two, not one.
If he really did like her and did like you, then he would have already dumped her for you.
Hang around until the bar closes, or visit a prison.
Please do not miss out on this one.
Believe it or not, women hate arrogant men.
Stick with what is inside of you.
Hell, it happened to me twice.
Perhaps you are young, I do not know.
No matter what he says, actions speak louder than words.
There is nothing in the world like a big boned girl!
Even if he is rich, do not sell yourself short.
I just moved to Sacramento. I am a gay male, 30 years old.
The people who are around you now, like your friends, should like you no matter what.
They like the little titis and pussys.
Wait until you are older and if you both still feel the same way, then go for it!
Yes, I am not one of those people, but I know there are many of them.
No, not if you have to ask.
You want to suck another man's bottom?
Because they are men, and they are not as confident as we are.
Does this mean he likes me?
Do not worry about him, just concentrate on school so you can learn and then worry about your boyfriend.
I dated one and I know.
Look at the way she walks.
No, at least I hope not.
Hello, I am looking to visit your country.
Should I give him another chance?
The same man you want to be in a relationship with?
I went and there he was.
That is what I called it, but why?
That way, you can still go by your last name.
Both of you work hard to get it right.
I have told her that I liked her and she said that she would not want to ruin our friendship.
You can join a community site with live chat and webcam chat.
Show her your naked baby pictures.
It is very important to last at least 30-45 minutes.
I am not telling you to be celibate until then.
If he is flirting with her, then you should leave him alone.
I love curly hair. I like to run my fingers through it.
I want my wife to grow as well.
That is just the way it is, I suppose.
One girl, Michelle, who probably would not mind being named, spoke up and said she did not believe in it.
I can just toss him to the side and forget about him like last night's trash.
However, he was a bit busy after that.
I do not know what to do because she knows how much I care about him.
If you do eat something like that, then just quit.
It could be that you need to urinate, or the last dream you had.
If he wants to wear my pants, all he has to do is ask.
If you were friends before and have stronger feelings now, then it should be okay.
I want to try again.
Figure out what style of arrangements you would like and flowers.
Lie, lie, lie, and then lie some more.
Wait until you find out for sure, and then go from there.
If the two of you are at a dance, he should not really care.
Trust him, do not bring it up again.
Honestly, most girls are just waiting for the guy to tell her how he truly feels.
Yes, I would love to meet the ladies.
I ponder this often.
I met a man once who was very romantic. I met him in a torrential rainstorm.
Okay, now some men like girls like that, and some men do not.
It comes right after threeplay and before fiveplay.
When I fall in love, I feel stupid.
If you have to ask, then you are not in love.
If you start to feel it coming on, then start the four play again.
I do not understand someone, please give me the answer.
I saved a good $500-600 by doing my own flowers and it was no hassle at all.
I just got a divorce, and so did he.
Ask a girl about the problems because I am a boy.
Be yourself, that is what girls like, at least most of them.
Follow your heart, it is not wrong.
They bother you all day long.
See if he calls, e-mails, or cares.
You can do a civilian arrest.
A spasm in your back usually.
By now, you might love your wife for everything you have endured.
Good luck, and I hope everything goes well!
Say, "I love you," and if you wait to say it back, it tells it all.
Try asking her out again and see what she says.
There is no way to make someone fall in love with you.
Ask her questions, not just talk.
When you first fall in love, you are gitty, goofy, and happy just thinking about that person.
Remember, there is more than one.
I think they look better than a lot of nations out there.
We got married all over again!
In all, I do not think it really matters.
I am not going to drive five hours just to hang out unless I really like her.
How often can you have sex with Pam Anderson?
I told her that I loved her and truly meant it.
Think about what good it brought about.
The thing is, I am a person that does not like to break other people's hearts.
Give a rose and express your love.
I like thick because I feel cheated with a thin one.
Remember, until death do you part!
It is because we always find a life partner with the opposite side.
What are you talking about?
If you keep talking to him for another week, he might think he is married to you.
Women do not want much, just some recognition and sometimes help.
That is what it seems like to me.
Do not be afraid to say no.
Break up with him. There are always more fish in the sea.
To me, it really does not matter, but a hand full is good enough for me.
Choose the one that adores you the most.
You still released at least a thousand.
You go to a bar and get drunk.
Give it some time and thought.
No, you should not leave them. You should teach them how to please you better.
Bebie hit the nail on the head.
No, men kiss when they are ready.
Julesac is funny, but mean.
If you are asking this, you surely have already distanced yourself from her and yet remain a friend.
Do not forget to choose and vote for the best answer.
Do not try to figure it out, that is just the way it is.
I do not know, but I know of another website that I go to.
It depends on how much you are starting to have feelings for this boy.
He must be a control freak.
It all depends on the girl or the guy, and how interested the girl is in him.
Try to get out and meet new people.
Usually, it is multiple things, not just one thing.
If you really like them.
For the guys, do you prefer a bigger woman or a smaller woman?
If all you do is argue, it is not worth it.
What makes it worse is that I already went out with him for four years.
You just have to be patient and the right girl will come along.
Unless you do not love your husband anymore, and you have room for another man?
Wife, because then you can do more without committing a sin.
She definitely wants you to think she is good looking, but she does not want that to be the first reason.
It depends, some days I want to have sex and some days I do not.
In addition, they are more passionate in making love.
If you play with both at the same time, she will probably beat you up.
Because he would not work, hit me, used guilt trips, and was a big mama's boy.
Perhaps because you are the most beautiful girl they have seen.
It really depends on if someone is vain or not.
Someone I can be myself with.
Send me your picture and contact me.
Stay away from this guy friend.
The doctor cannot believe it.
Yes, definitely, especially when she throws up.
If not, then do not worry about it.
I could give you some pointers.
If you feel your love is fading, do not just sit there and do nothing.
I will not stay with someone I do not trust.
I only once told a girl that I loved her, and I meant it.
You married him and it was for a reason.
You should rip off your shirt and yell "Tarzan!"
Yes, girl down there, do not have sex.
They accept this in their culture.
Always trail ride with a friend.
You did not give us very good information. Do you all live in one house?
Move on, even if he is attractive, looks are not everything.
The most important thing is to be yourself.
Yes, be disappointed and be mad.
Sorry, I have never felt that way.
I will not like any girl who would make my life difficult.
If he gets them first, then you get the popcorn.
Practice and ask if you are doing well.
If you are sure, then tell your parents if you have not done so already.
I met mine at a carnival.
That sounds like a rhetorical question.
I believe everyone should keep their own name.
However, your first kiss should feel like you are in heaven.
There is nothing but trouble there.
How can I make a woman happy?
Do not do things that can get you hurt.
Of course you will be making more money if you work hard.
Please do not go up to her and tell her how good she looks.
I do not think it is a good idea. You are not there for this purpose.
Go up to her and say, "Hi, are you single?"
I think he would make a great Valentine.
Be prepared to let her go.
Rather than just sit there and wait until you are a good one.
Just tell them, what are they going to do, slap you?
Get a massage and get away from it all.
If you really like this guy, smile and make nice talk to him.
Take them both out at the same time.
It happened to me, and I am now dating that person.
There are only two points to make friends.
So, you might just be over looking the type of men who think the world of you.
I would prefer someone who does not hate you.
We tried to move on, but it did not work.
When will people in this messed up world finally realize this?
I would not bother calling him back.
Try not to spend time with him and find another man.
Look for another attractive girl, so she will be jealous.
In my opinion, you are not promiscuous.
Red means love, and black means death.
If she likes him, then she does not like you, so dump her. It is not his fault that she strays.
For me, anything after three days and I might start to forget about you.
Find a girl who has breasts and must be pretty.
There is no one you can trust more than a good friend.
Start the day off with breakfast out, then perhaps a nice walk.
If she says yes, then go pick them up.
If yes, why do I hear some girl say flowers are not going to last?
Perhaps it is interesting for them.
Could it ever be the same?
It is not that bad, at least it is not Bella.
Could it be because some men are liars and have large mouths?
You could tell her and have one of those fairy tale romances.
Finally, a culture that has it right.
My twin will not talk or listen to me.
If you want to get something you can not get rid of, then go ahead.
Only I am not thinking about him, but I am having dreams about him.
If you are talking about ten, then I think it would be fine to get a video or computer game.
Go for it and take the chance!
If he cannot, then take him to a place where they have slowdancing.
I believe this is the most beautiful aspect of a family life.
It is your choice not to hate one. I dislike them to say the least.
Never get married without a prenuptial agreement.
Get a life and do not waste mine.
She says you are too good for her?
Guys come and go, but friends are forever!
It could probably mean a lot of things.
Yes, it is normal because there are many people who still like some they broke up with.
I would like to hear what a black female has to say about this.
Guys are stupid. Who knows why they do what they do?
If they gave you their phone number, you do not have to wait at all.
They are the masters of the universe.
Buddy the Elf, I am in love and do not care who knows it.
Whatever you do, do not try to have both of them at the same time.
If you really wanted to be with him, you would not be asking.
Remember, being friends with someone online is okay, but there are limits.
When my sister kisses someone, she closes her eyes to get ready.
Now, I would not marry any woman who did not want to change her name, but that is just my opinion.
It is a small party for the family.
Girls are perverts, they just hide it and act like it around other girls.
I am only in my thirteenth grade.
However, you do what you want.
Do not do that, it will not work.
If they do not, then it is time to move on.
He is everything I ever wanted with the looks, money, and stuff.
Yes, and it is bad luck to see the bride at the wedding.
No, she is not a liar.
Please be quiet and be gay if you want to.
He had his nose pierced.
Yes, I can lift him, but he is only 185 pounds.
You need a therapist for that.
Maybe some perverted guys like the really young looking Asian girls.
You should see a psychiatrist.
He is acting the way he did before, giving you excuses of the wall.
Be strong and hang in there.
No, he is too large and I am too weak.
Basically, if she is so drunk that she becomes a slob or slut, then yes, it is unattractive.
Exchange letters, emails, chat online, talk over the phone, send packages, just keep in touch!
Especially if you do not feel like it.
He dribbles, shoots, and scores two points.
Giving it up just for him to stay is like selling your soul to the devil.
I cannot give you a wife view, but I hope mine is just as good.
It takes the pressure off of me to ask someone.
It depends on the woman, but it is better shaved.
Ask in English. I cannot understand you.
I am a man, but I will tell you a little.
I like him a lot and I want to win him over, not push him away.
I really like this guy, but I do not know if he likes me back.
By the way, your avatar looks familiar.
It has been over six months and I cannot seem to get over it.
Perhaps he thinks he will be rejected. Just ask. I would.
You have to think about that, and that should help you out on seeing if you can trust him.
A picture of the shape of a heart with you and her when you both first dated is special.
I am in college and he is my only source of income until I get out.
I got with my ex-boyfriend in 2nd grade, then again in 4th, and then again in 8th.
I have been with this girl for eight months and we have not kissed. Is this bad?
Some men do not like breasts at all.
Is it possible that she just wants to see other people?
He has seen me every day for about four or five years.
There was his stop, so he got off the train.
I mean, the worst is that she says no.
However, I know exactly what I want in a relationship.
I would flirt and send flowers and candies to myself, and then he would ask you out sometime.
I also hate seeing my dad unhappy.
I feel bad because I know that I snore sometimes. Most people do, right?
I like women and need to know if I am in love.
If you truly love each other, then you can work out all the fighting.
Neither of you have the courage to end the relationship.
However, that does not mean that big girls cannot be cute.
However, he is getting married this month.
However, those men are jerks and you do not want them anyway.
Say, "Will you go out with me?"
Get married only after you have been with a man for more than two years.
Men have penises, and women have clitoris.
Separate from the bad situation and move on.
It would be easier to do if I were mad, though!
If she tells the administration, I will be expelled because it is Pakistan, not America.
You should get to know her and sooner or later you will ask her out or she will.
As I said, he already knows that you like him, so just take a deep breath and ask him.
Maybe you and I can get together sometime and we will find love with one another.
I would be, but I am just married.
Play the field a bit more now.
As everyone said, do not get married so early.
I just want to know if you have been to the DOC yet.
Pay attention to what the other person says.
Just talk to your spouse about this.
If you are interested in sixth graders, you are obviously young.
I was thinking about a medium pink color, but with what?
Ask if they would like to go somewhere with you.
A trip to an amusement park such as a roller coaster or even a theatrical museum.
Is it true that men prefer larger women?
The problem is that I really like him.
I would say that they do work out, but not often. I hope this helps.
Should I break up with him because of his mother?
I did this before, accidentally, and my friend was mad that I deleted him.
I do not think I mind either way.
But that is her way. You could try it that way, or you could just keep your eyes open.
There are some that do, but you should be able to tell.
Are you talking about your avatar?
I do not remember giving a girl a Christmas gift unless I liked her.
I do not know what to do.
Try to be yourself and do not show off.
Take it day by day, step by step. Think of how he lost a good thing.
If only every man knew what women want, the world would be a much happier place.
Give her compliments, honesty, and make it about her.
I think they will crash him.
It just means that she is really interested in the guy.
Please do, I think you would get slapped mid-reach or kicked in the groin.
She and I are both divorced.
If he or she wants to see your picture immediately, it is sex.
It is better than her giving you a fake number to call.
Tell her to move to Massachusetts.
If you feel this strongly about it, then maybe you should not get married.
I would say either Maui or the Bahamas based on the pictures I have seen.
The man I am interested in is angry with me.
You are 13 years old, so do not worry about it.
That way, you do not have to worry about calling him too much.
I am a guy and let me tell you, we love to chase!
Thank you for the pep in advance!
We always seem to push the ones that we love away.
They think that they can control other people's lives when they cannot.
That is strange, but maybe I will talk to my friend by his locker.
I do not know. How would you like something stuffed up your butt?
If a guy cares, he calls.
What special gift can I give my brother in law for his birthday?
He probably does not want to either.
Hold her hands, look into her eyes, and say it, but only say it if you really love her.
Some men do, and some men do not.
I really want to know, so please help me out!
The timing just was not right for it with the old man. You will see!
Generally kind and my fifth point is that I will be disappointed if she is unintelligent.
It is one of the gifts we can always give ourselves.
I do not believe trust has to be earned, because how is that even possible?
If that is you, you need to stop. That is strange.
Do not let her rule your life, she will just have to learn to deal with it.
I have Yahoo email and it works for me.
I would not worry too much about it.
Yes, the trick ass hoe has never had a chance.
When you can fart in front of the one you are dating.
It depends on how old they are.
Any guy who thinks he would is probably not being honest with himself.
If you flirt with him, the challenge is not there.
If you need your ex emotionally, then you have some problems.
She does not have to be younger than you.
My guess is that she does not love you, but try to use your brean, not your hair.
If you want your girlfriend forever, then do not let her know that you want her forever. Simple.
There are many inexpensive ideas out there, just find what you like and work with it.
If you are worried about performance, do not do it.
Find a new girl and if that does not work, then move back.
Most often, but not always, that will be guys around your age. Give and take.
If you act like that all the time, she might think you are desperate.
Not everyone on here is in school.
Tell him what you really want. That is what they tell me, but never get to do. Speak up.
Should I make the first move or should I wait for him to make the first move?
What a typical double standard you have set up.
After a while, you do not even see the color.
I haven't tried it yet, but I am still trying to get up the nerve.
If you are serious, then asking her that question should not bother her.
You should ask her out. What is up with that?
Would you like to go out with me sometime?
Yes, look me up if you are ever in Florida.
I tell you, those were good times.
It is all about her, and no, it should not be something that happens on a first date.
Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone you argue with all the time?
If he comes to his senses, great. If not, then break up with him.
You are too good for them.
Do you think she jumps him because she likes him?
Depending on the age, CD's or DVD's.
20 years down the road is all you can be, so start from the beginning.
I would like to visit the United States. What are the necessary things?
If you have any ideas, tips, or general information, please email me back.
You sound like a very lovely person, so do not let some of these girls drag you down.
You do not have to look, just go out and enjoy yourself and have fun and a girlfriend will come along.
Do not pursue it, he is getting married.
It looks like clear liquid that turns yellow when dry.
If in your country there is a short messaging system in your cellphone, then find a textmate.
When she starts closing her eyes, kiss her in the lips and then it is up to you.
Please be honest with me, I can handle the truth.
Have fun, but remember to never get so comfortable that you always know what is going to happen next.
It shows how much they care about you.
Tell her that you miss her and that you love her.
Coffee, lunch, site seeing, walk, talk, play in the park, museum, movie matinee.
What you want is a hooker. You can find that in any corner of the world.
Now we do all these things together and I do not know what to do.
Because if it fails, you will be very upset.
It has been the best thing for at least me.
Try using some of these, but only if they actually apply.
The problem is that he cheated on me recently and it was the worst thing he could have done.
If you are happy, she should be happy, unless he is really being bad to you.
We like it when guys do things for us and think about us.
Perhaps if you give him space, he will eventually call you back.
Tell him that you do not want a real relationship.
If you look creepy and you look, they will all think you are leering.
I do not know about love, but he definitely likes you.
If a guy really respects you, then he will understand.
If you can afford it, do it if you want to.
Because he is a superhero that is the closest to being just a regular guy.
Sometimes the difficulties are worth it if the good outweighs the bad.
I do not think it is wise to date at work.
You need a theory class for that.
Let it take it's course from there.
What do they think about gay marriage and relationships?
Of course, I had to ask him if he was ignoring me.
Men will think you are attractive regardless of this.
However, I do not think that by not having sex with him, he will become unfaithful or leave you.
The safest rules of internet dating are these: 1. Chat via email and messenger. 2. Chat on the phone.
Marriage is really about trusting and communicating.
Okay, so I had this problem too.
It depends on what you kissed.
It depends on if you could trust him before.
Make sure you do not make her hate you, just get your point across to her.
Where have you been meeting these Filipinas?
I would be upset if it was just considered love.
That way, you are not exactly telling them what you specifically do not like about them.
If he is, then go for it!
Then see if she is available for dinner and a movie.
I am sorry, I do not know, and I wish the best of luck to both of you!
However, I find him looking at me occasionally.
This is sin. We have started this ourselves.
Fun includes eating meals, but not breakfast if you understand what I mean.
Make a kind move, and if there is no response, you know what to do.
Let him make the first move. If you do, it may make you look like you are obsessed with him.
You people have no right to get married.
My tragic love story was that I loved him very much and he loved me too.
You seem desperate, and you will never find a partner if you are desperate.
However, he claims that we are only friends.
Unless you are trying to prove something, appearance does not matter.
I know once you have sex with him, he is no longer a good friend.
The fact that a guy is so self centered is a huge turn off for me.
Do not rush it. Feel all your emotions come alive.
It is a two way traffic, until you get them, you will know which one it is.
You have one child out of wedlock.
I know I am overtly picky about people. How can I stop it?
It hurts a lot. Maybe some girls might say that is it?
I am going to jump that boy. Is that the right choice?
It was a good idea.
If she gets drunk, then it is not a turn off.
Some women send men tiny messages without saying it clearly.
I would prefer if they left me alone. Sorry, I got off-topic.
Ask her to go do something she is interested in or to see a movie she would like to see.
You are a man, a term used lightly.
It is unfortunate that it is not automatic like MSN or AOL.
That is how they will react to it, so it is a bad situation for you and him.
Go back to that person at once before it becomes too late for you.
I also want to smack that smile off of her face.
Ask if he wants to dance with you.
Then she might say, "That looks ugly, I think a color looks better."
Ask him to see a doctor.
I never went out with him a second time.
First of all, why did you break up?
Why wait? Go ahead and do it.
As long as he does not mind, who else's opinion matters?
I think I am still in love with him.
I never wanted to have sex again.
The main thing is to not try to get back at the one who wronged you.
If you have to ask other people, I do not think you are ready.
I am a lesbian, and I say those things.
Flowers are a big savings area.
Time will tell. Give it six months and see what happens.
Either that, or you are the only one he has a chance at getting some booty from.
From your list, I would have to choose Spiderman.
I was cheated on for three of the years.
All seniors think freshman girls are easy, which is sad but true.
If he says yes, then you can tell him.
And impress her with affection and love.
If you have, what was it like?
You should celebrate Valentine's Day with joy and fun. Give each other gifts and have a good time.
Any woman other than the unattractive men will look attractive.
When I moved in, my neighbor asked me out.
You should probably make a move because he is probably shy.
As time goes on, it will be on a much harsher scale.
Be yourself and say what is going on and you might get a response.
There are many times that you love a man, but you are not sure if he loves you as well.
If you are talking about my husband, I would say tools, toys for his vehicle, and sports related things.
That made me very attractive, but I ran off.
I will pay the tab if I can get your vote for the best answer.
What size of breasts does the average guy like, do you think?
Many women age 22 are dating men age 27, so the 22 year old men feel insecure and have to fish downstream.
Lust less like, you just go out?
They probably know you can't hide that, but you should tell your parents.
I will make you a princess on planet Kripton.
My last girlfriend's boyfriend did that to her before we met, and she still kept him.
My friend has a boyfriend who she talks to online and on the phone.
Do you prefer fake nails or manicured ones?
Tell her that girls like to be told the truth. Good luck.
We can stay together and be the best of friends.
Stay true to your husband. After all, he is the one you said I do to.
Do not listen to these fools with their lies.
Yes, I am a man, so I do not really have to pay.
Remember, no bird has ever landed on one wing.
Let her know how you feel.
It depends. If you really love him, you will probably think you want to earn it.
If you or the other person is married, then you should leave.
No, men do not, but little boys do.
Please help me win this debate with her.
My girlfriend is the nuttiest, but I love her anyway.
It is simple, do as anyone else does, play with it.
Let him go. If he is meant to be with you, he will come back to you.
After three days, my back went out.
Stay alive and get your old life back.
That is why I ask why men do not always know what they want with any kind of relationship.
Perhaps ask him out to lunch or a movie.
Girls do not like guys who are only about themselves.
It depends, do you like either one?
I was always looking and I kept picking jerks.
No, I feel it is a choice and one does what feels comfortable to them.
Some do, some do not have it in them.
Do what makes you happy.
Because for some reason, I cannot.
It would have to be love.
Because, you know, try to search for love, but be careful.
Do not ask her to perform some act for you, make her the spotlight.
Girls are simply impressed if you can show a little care, respect, and honesty.
Tell him to leave.
They believe it is the only correct way.
Good luck and keep calm.
You need to figure out if you want to stay married to him.
I hate him for it.
Men like this typically become wife beaters if you do not obey them.
First of all, I have four children, so being a homemaker is more work than my job.
No, I haven't. I prefer normal-looking guys.
It definitely looks like he has feelings for you. Do you show how you feel? You should!
Everything seems so open and hit and run with most people these days.
I have a problem of opening up to men and perhaps I told this man too much.
The right date can save money on many things.
If you truly love your man and want to work it out, then tell your ex to respect that.
That only makes her easier to bed.
I do not think you should try it.
It is simple, honesty and love, and try to be honest with them.
I am hoping for at least 90%, but realistically I think it is more like 70% or 65%.
However, cuddling up with large women is one of the best feelings I know of.
Women also expect men to act like that, so why should they grow up?
There are a couple of ways to get him drunk.
The problem is not whether you ask her while at work or not.
Stick with the 13 and 14 year old boys, they are easier to control anyway. Good luck!
You should never let a man mistreat you.
I am not a stay-at-home romantic dinner type of girl.
When I left him, I swore I would never get married again.
Pickup lines are tacky. Just be yourself and reassure her a lot. Women like that.
You will be fine, just have fun.
Not all the time, sometimes men shave them, it depends on the woman.
I love him, but I think I am ready to move on and meet new men.
Wait for another four years.
I hope I see some of it soon.
I do not want to be mean.
Also, you should wait a while before having children.
I would like to have some fun with you, that is why I answered this stupid question.
Try to contact their Q&A team. They will help you through. Have a nice day!
Because women do not put out often.
If he continues to insist, it means he is only interested in sex.
B) Looks definitely matter. Anyone saying they do not is probably lying.
Making love is like living a fantasy.
When you are 18 or 20 because when they say something they do not mean it.
When possible, try to make it yourself.
There is always a but, isn't there?
If she is not interested in you anymore.
I seriously doubt that you are in love with that many men.
On average, I would say about 45% at first, but once you get to know the person, maybe 15%.
You should play sports with your male friends.
She will tell you if it is not okay.
I do not mean, do you think women are sexy and beautiful?
How do I get him to stop nagging me and leave me alone?
A sex toy, that way you can both enjoy it.
Men without hair look like little boys to me, and it is not sexy at all.
I agree, just kiss him and he will respond one way or another.
A good way is to imagine yourself without him or her.
Here in America, it is not so important.
If it was before you, then he was not being unfaithful.
How many times have I passed up a great opportunity by worrying about someone saying no.
The reason is that the white women are taking up all the men.
Your self image is also very important.
Have you ever had a pap smear?
How old are you?
However, I think they both like me.
Well, first of all, it sounds as if you guys are already married.
Jaime is going to ask Rubi out, but it is not your business.
That is a sign. Things like that can make it very obvious.
You should take the time to get to know both of them equally without going out with them.
I would love to hear logical opinions on this, thank you.
If you like the man, then go for it.
Having fun with male friends is okay.
It is natural with that man.
Women take on a lot and sometimes they feel like they do it for nothing.
No, because I am not married yet.
Please let me know what you think. Thank you.
If you are homosexual, then be homosexual.
Good luck and hang in there.
I like older girls, so I think it is sick and wrong that they cannot go out with her.
I am curious to what everyone thinks.
My last boyfriend I met driving round a roundabout in another car.
Because if you do, then you are going to lose your friend over a guy.
It was a casual aside when I said it. I didn't think he would remember.
Are you a country girl or a city girl?
Spend all day together, and to top it off touch his feet.
I am very bored being single. I sit back and watch other girls having all the fun!
Women are curious about sex with other women, even myself.
I do not know what you said because I was too lazy to read your typing.
I hate it myself, but I love the straight ones.
This is Doc Izzy, and I love and adore larger women.
There are not any words that are going to make it any better.
Do it before it is too late.
To tell you the truth, you learn, but you have to actually do it.
Nay Pier is a great place or one of the museums. There are many great restaurants and hotels.
That is a stereotype. I am not a country girl by the way. I think I am sexy in my own way.
He will not turn you down.
I hope you read this well.
Many men like large women, and most of them are black.
If she is interested, she will call later.
No, you will not because you know he has cheating tendencies.
Ask yourself that question, if you understand what I mean.
I find if I try hard, I can see things I know aren't there normally.
Let's have coffee and chat and take it from there.
Move on with your life and find someone else to be friends with.
I am sure you are not, but try emailing me atilikethickchix@yahoo.com and I will be honest.
My relationship with this boy has been going on since last year.
I really care about you and I cannot stop thinking about you.
It is worth the wait when you are ready.
If you do not know, ask someone who would.
Keep away from your fear and tell him.
That is a risk you are going to have to take.
Drink up if you want to be attractive to losers, creeps, and perverts.
Not for anything but looking at.
After a while, I still love him.
As you said, it is your own life.
Even after divorce, I am still stuck with it.
Just because he has the potential to be a great boyfriend, does not mean he is.
Sure, let me know more about you.
When one minute you want to throttle the other person and the next you want to jump their bones.
The girls that are pretty or have a great personality.
People whose parents take care of them are lazy.
I do not know what she wants.
It is very complicated. Please tell it again, but in simple terms.
Show her what you are good at.
If you can imagine him as the father of your children.
If you do not ask, someone else might.
That is why I am single.
If you really love him, you would let him go.
If she does not want to be with you, try to be her friend.
If he says he is not, believe him.
Let's get it out of limbo.
I even worked there for awhile and met the man of my dreams.
I have been married to my husband for four years. We recently got married in December of 2005.
Focus on how things are and what would be best for you right now.
You will see that no matter how hurt you are, it is still the simplest reason why you smile.
I did not think Pakistan was that conservative.
I have to stop immediately because I am ready to relieve myself.
Whatever you do, do not tell him too soon.
We cannot answer if she truly means it.
I do not like a guy that does that all the time.
Then you can make an easier decision.
I have had sexual relations with many women and some of them are prostitutes.
He dribbles, shoots, and scores two points.
Talk to your best friend and see if it is interesting.
Is this a trick question?
I do not know, can I do anything about it?
People are husbands and wives for a variety of reasons.
If he does not, then there are too many fish in the sea.
Do you want to say that?
If you are not happy, fix it or leave.
Not all guys, but some guys do.
I completely agree with Udaman. Good luck, girl.
It sounds like you like to sell yourself too much.
Your girlfriend will just think you are a jerk.
Sometimes, but you have to observe the one you call your man.
Replaying everything you ever did to me?
Do not just sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
I dated a man this past year and he got to a violent point.
Leave it alone. I do not care what she says, she is in enough pain.
How would anyone know if they do not know anything about you?
Find one that loves you as well.
It never hurts to be flirtatious.
We were hanging out a little.
Do not use pick up lines, that is a turn off.
I love them because I am a guy and I do not have to ask anyone to the dance.
Girl, there are more guys out there that love thick women than you think.
The girls that whine that flowers do not last are just ungrateful.
You need to be with that person, you have found your true love.
You should really be her friend.
How do I get my sweetheart to show me he loves me?
Well, basically, you have to stop talking to him and stop thinking about him.
They have never met, but she says they are in love.
Do not do this over the phone, email, etc.
I am not against gay people, because they are the best friends a person can have.
I am interested in a girl and I want to know how to know if she is interested in me or not.
Death is like a box full of candy corn.
Try to make the best of what is to come.
Either you move on with your life or you try to make it work with this person.
She is the love of my life and I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with her.
Women think with their brains.
I am still in love with my ex and I am mad at my cousin because my ex likes her.
Only time will tell. Spend time with friends and have fun. Do not worry about it.
That is why I do not get in chat rooms anymore, unless it is to laugh at all the freaks.
This is what I did. It was a big mistake on my part.
I have no idea where to begin.
However, he died, so I guess I can lift or carry my husband.
If she is calling just to flirt, then tell her to not call you so often.
That is all I have to say.
You should not be asking this question?
I was also thinking about lime green.
I mean the both of you together.
I have a close girlfriend.
Wanting to be something they are not?
Well, if you can imagine yourself with him in bed at night.
They like the challenge. I know that is what I love about it.
It depends on the girl, fair skinned females look extra pale when they have black hair.
I should do that when I am dating next time.
Do not listen to what anyone else tells you to do.
I really like this guy, but I do not know if it is just a crush or if I love him.
I think the Bomb is easier.
Not always the easiest years, but they have been pretty good years.
Do not forget to choose and vote for the best answer.
You should tell her why you like her.
Did you turn gay, or is it a curiosity thing?
No, not if you have to ask.
The list could go on and on.
However, he might enjoy all the waiting, dreaming, and teasing.
Do not eat where you take advantage of others.
If you would like to chat, please email me at fla_cat_blue@yahoo.com.
When he teases you about little things.
If you think that he feels the same way about you, why not?
In my experience, a lot of the time one of them ends up cheating on the other.
They are often worse than men.
I have heard of friends getting married about six months after meeting someone.
I do not know what you mean.
If you want to have children, then become a homemaker.
What is the worst thing that could happen?
A woman with intelligence is attractive.
His or her intelligence, the way they carry themselves, good looks, and personality.
Sure, and will you pay mine as well?
Yes, that is all I can say, but yes, I have long black hair and I am proud!
I was not going to let her win.
Chances are, if you like her as a friend, you will like her as more.
Just be yourself when you are with her.
Men think that they are special, and that they are only good enough for certain women.
Find someone you like and say, "Will you be my Valentine?"
Please post more questions on Yahoo Answers.
Well, if the one boy picks on you, why like him?
Brokeback Mountain, okay it is a guy, but at least you will be happy!
Size, shape, looks, etc should not matter at all.
Sex is not the only thing that is important in life.
You are probably too good for him anyway.
Do you like him or do you not like him?
Why don't you just ask her if you can kiss her?
Who can say that country girls feel more sexy?
Well, I do not know how old you are, which would help.
Think about what you like and do it for them, similar to a tongue massage.
My answer is that most guys definitely do not prefer girls that are skin and bones.
Cut your cousin and your ex-boyfriend off completely.
Does his friends point at you when you are with him?
Yes, it is very possible to enjoy giving pleasure more than receiving it.
Now I keep thinking of having sex with a girl.
It depends on whether they are brunette or not.
Is she just trying to use you?
You can have a big penis and suck in bed.
Get rid of the ex if you are dating the man you love right now.
It was painful and I bled.
Cuddling, kissing, fondling, and playing with each other's sex organs before sex.
When he does explain to him that it was a mistake to break up and want him back.
My boyfriend loves me very much and does not want to give me up.
You are already doing it, so why bother?
On the hood of my car at a waterfront in a light rain was awesome!
I think you are probably a nice guy and she probably loves you a lot.
You are looking too hard, or maybe you are looking in the wrong places. You should sign up for Yahoo personals.
Only if you want it to be.
If she does not have a reason, then she is not your friend.
You have to find what is right for you and your partner/s.
Do not worry, you are definitely not promiscuous.
Girls do not think it is cool, they think it is guys who smoke because they are killing their friends.
Do you like Asian food?
They do not mean to get them pregnant, they just cannot keep it in their pants because they are pigs!
I like natural, real girls. I do not like fake looking, prissy drama queens.
Take on how the world works, and their desire to catch up.
That is too many, and selfish. You are just desperate and keep trying another one, right?
It is like if you decide to eat chocolate and then complain because you look too fat.
Do you know he loves you?
My wife forgives me for many things.
First you order one online and then the stork brings one to you.
I would say around three or four.
Imagine that I am that guy and you are my girlfriend.
Give them a chance to discover you.
It is unusual, but nothing bad.
I still love him. What should I do?
Do not just stay with him for the baby.
Never ignore her, always listen to her, and when you do not change, women hate that.
It can be good luck as well if you take it as good luck.
It is a man thing, live with it.
It sounds like you are going through a lot right now.
Good luck, but do your homework.
Do not come here, it smells like a trap to me.
Just ask any girl passing by, but only in Thailand, not in the United States.
This woman does not want a bad boy at all.
However, I need to be happy.
You are so full of it, teasing all these desperate lonely sad sad guys, shame on you.
Sometimes men think they do not need you until you are gone.
I wish you the best of luck.
You married your husband hopefully because you love him.
I love to express my feelings to the ladies with poems. Has anyone written one for a special someone?
Why tie yourself to just one man?
That is, if you both agree to doing this.

He just has to start over and earn your trust again.
I met his father on his side of the family.
We fall in love, but they treat us badly. Why are we there?
I am one of those who want to wait until they are completely in love with someone.
Try the nice way first. Girls hate being ignored.
Keeping secrets will only hurt the ones you love.
Some women like big hairy guys, some guys like fat women, some girls like skinny guys, and vice versa.

I do not know, but Daniel K has never read manga.

I like intelligent, fun, and attractive women.
Come to my town and I will be your girlfriend.
This generation is simply too unintelligent.
Yes, it is time to cash in your chips.
They are always in love.
When I see a Malaysia air ad on television, I go gaga.
It was really nice how he asked me on a date.
Try talking to her and asking her to hang out as friends, see if it goes somewhere.
This is difficult because there are many temptations out there.
It is not what you can become just because she says so.
The two of you should talk privately and personally. You have to clear each other's sides, so do it now.
The one I liked goes like this.
Do not try to have sex.
Just keep it cool. Being a little hard to get might help!
If your relationship survives the four seasons, I suppose you should be ready.
I married my guy anyway, and do you know why? Besides love.
Move on and find someone who does not hate you.
You cannot, so let's just start discussing it.
Yes, we like flowers that are pretty and good smelling.
Should I or should I not? Older man versus younger woman.
Those other replies are just cocky, I am more attractive.

If he does not start acting right, then leave him.
If you are attractive too, show him your breasts.
There are a lot of men like that who are only looking for sex.
I mess up often, but she does not forget.
Wait for him to ask you out until you are ready.
You are asking if I like you.
Whatever you decide, make it completely yours.
Her parents? You can't fix it. Her friends? Maybe you can talk to them nicely, but please specify why.
How drunk is this girl getting?
Girls love guys with positive self-images.
I am doing this simply for the points.
If you don't know anything about each other, you can't connect.
If you do, then I would say it was a real and worth realtionship. Good luck!
If you are used to it and you like it, then go with it.
It is because it is buy one, take one.
Does he always happen to be staring?
It sounds like a con, but I am telling you, women like it.
You have met the unintelligent people who think skinny is better.
However, I have always believed that there is a huge difference between having sex and making love.
You just have to make yourself walk away.
In my case, I think 80% is correct.
He is leaning in and giving me a soft kiss on the forehead.
I cannot see my life without my husband.
I do. I am much prettier and smooth as silk.
Flowers are nice even if they do not last.
It sounds like he is having too much fun while you are away.
Why don't you just leave the girl alone?
Maybe you should try dating girls if guys offend you so much.
I also have not a single girlfriend.
Just remember, go for guys who are themselves and only themselves.
They feel that they are better than women, but they are wrong.
That does not mean you should let them in.
It is always in the back of my mind.
Does she have other friends to talk to on the phone?
Getting married and having a child can wait, but studies cannot.
However, you need to do this a few times.
Most teen boys prefer girls that like sex.

I do not know what I should do.
Yes, it is a sick habit.
Wait until you are 25. You will not lose your charm by then.
My best friend hates my boyfriend and wishes for me to break up with him, but I will not.
Relax and be real. That is what we like.
I do not think so, maybe they should try taking our last names.
You both should choose either his or yours once you have children.
Of course he wants to go on.
I suppose I would pick domestic goddess.
Ask her out after class again.
Life is too short, live it to the fullest and have faith.
I am a man and I too feel so because I am a man.
If you like him that much, call him.
Start with a basic everyday question and go from there.
Tell more people. My friend did.
All my friends want to do is makeout.
Also, actual kissing and asking if you are a good kisser.

You need to reput it and add it back just like the first time.
You can share this with your mother or father.

There are many things that make a woman not like sex.
Not all men get bored and move on.
However, there is no better person to marry than your best friend.
Depending on what you are looking for, friendship is best.
I did this with my current boyfriend.
However, it does not mean you cannot love another person.
Just divorce that man. He has no honor and he does not love you.
Most men only want a girlfriend for free sex.
If nothing works, you will have to ask him for it again.
It is your personality, so keep it. Whether a guy goes out with you should not determine how you act.
You have to search yourself for this one.
If the man is worthy enough, you will not need to.
I am confused. I hate the girl to be like that. What shall I do?
You should shop around for invitations and everything else.
He then asked me, "Can I come with you?"
Just go with your feelings. If you like her so much, then go with it.
I am only myself around men I do not like, and you know the outcome.
I hope you find a nice girl.
I have liked this on Girl since I was in the ninth grade.

He already knows that you like him, and has he said anything negative about it?
You will know if you confront him and ask him.
It is more of a trust issue I would say.
Never stop trying to impress her.
No, you are punished with no television for a month.
I think this is better than the one on top of me.
However, that did not bother me, because as I said, they were just friends.
If you go to school, you can still come home or call your family and friends.
You should go with the one who picks on you because nine times out of ten he likes you.
I always felt the same way, but when I met my true love, my perspective changed.
Do you take baths? Do you know how to speak?
I like him and he says things like, "If I were not dating, I would go out with you."
You will be better off if you break up with him.
This is the one time in your life when you can truly live out the true fantasy of love.
People asked me, "What's the hurry?"
Has he just dumped a girl and left before?
Needless to say, I am 36 now and still in therapy around it.

Did you ever think of that?
It has been half a year. Is it normal to still like him?
Look for a man that is attractive.
It is very sweet and just what you are looking for.
Is there a reason that you are not with the baby's father?
You are wasting your health because girls hate it.
Anything larger than a handful is a waste, probably a size c or d.
I believe that they do.
Stop trying to slap it in everyone's face.
You should probably look in a public place where you are most comfortable.
A man asked me, "Would you mind if we cuddle?"
Did you ask about the score of the last game?
Because some couples never get to that comfortable boring stage.

Even the day after would be okay.
Well, all you are missing is a million dollar smile.
I hear you Fountain. The same thing happened to me.
However, I do not really like girls all that much.
Be nice, give eye contact, and smile a lot. I hope this helps!
I would wonder why he shaved them, but in the end, they are his legs.
I wish you both the best of luck.

Ask your best friend if it would be okay.
Many people will tell you no.

Flirt with him and see how he responds.
I am waiting until I am married, but when is it too far?
There is nothing wrong with her taking your number.
You do not have to be an overly happy, hyperactive person.
I do not want to just randomly go up and be like, "Go out with me."
Then comes the fun part, he making it up to you.
You should give at least five minutes for kissing, hugging, and perhaps some licking.
I can't help any more unless I have more information.
Because I say no on avatars.
Some girls prefer gifts that won't die on them.
He is probably wondering if you are interested in him at all. Flirt back.
I feel goofy, dorky, and happy.
If you are promiscuous, then he is as well. Personally, I do not think you are one.
There are some men who only say the L word if they mean it.
I do not need a trophy girl, I want a companion.
As a man, let me say this.
Listen to what she has to say and always believe in yourself. Do not be arrogant.
Then he said, "Do you want some of my chapstick?"
There is not a wrong or right way to kiss anyone.
Because we love them, it is not until later when we think about it that we realize what we have done.
I would not know because I have the same issue.
What was the mistake that you made?
It is like breaking a drug habit.
Tell him, and it would not seem psycho because you have known each other for a long time.
That girl answered for me.
What about blue and green?
A life of your own, a life you have been missing out on.
It is confusing. Yes, I think you are correct.
You do not have to ask her out to go out with her.
Maybe he is going to call you.
Okay, tell her, but be as polite as possible.
When I was 16, I lost my virginity in a park.
What man does not like large breasts?
You should be proud of yourself.
Yes, men work and fix things, but what else can you do?
We do not know what you look like.
If you could have four qualities in your woman, what would they be?
If you look in the internet, you will find many things for the wedding or your local newspaper or news.
If she sits on your best friend's lap because she is drunk, then yes, it is a turn off.
See my boyfriend? Go to my 360.
You will find a man who truly deserves you one day.
Well, you, and that sexy perfume you wear.
If he is not and you are still not ready, then end the relationship.
Why do they want it state sanctioned?
She still allows me to play with my trucks and watch cartoons.
Move on, but you can still love him.
See if he is willing to go out of his way for you.
If anyone knows, please let me know.
I never knew life could be so good!
He said that he would call me back.
Pick the one you like the most.
Please remove it from the pop-up block.
If you truly love him, you will tell him.
Who knows, but I would absolutely love that to be done for me.
What should I do to get her?
You have to accept it and introduce yourself.
There are some movies that I have not seen yet.
I think it all depends on age, upbringing, etc.
That will only be sexual intercourse.
My boyfriend was definitely my friend first, and it is total bliss!
Who cares what anyone else thinks?
Also, try getting some blonde highlights.
Let it all out. I use art to vent problems that I have.
If she likes music, make a special CD or tape.
Choose one and why?
Do not worry about what people will say.
I think a lot of girls like receiving flowers.
I cannot explain it, and no, it has nothing to do with them looking young, vulnerable, or submissive.
Let him go, either that or date his brother.
Yes, there are, you just have to look.
You can get them in Staples for $35.
Your child is going to have a hard enough time growing up without a father.
My friend says I am too nice and I should tell them no.
My girlfriend always says she loves me when we are passing notes during class, but she does not say it confrontationally.
That is correct, the right relationship happened on it's own.
You will look foolish.
No, and you should not care. If you like him, then stay with him.
I think you should be yourself, have self esteem, and self confidence.
Anything that is not fixed.
If you really want to be with her, make it your top priority to see her.
One of my best friends had a relationship with my big sister a few months ago.
Should I just forget about it and move on?
On the other hand, their friends are a different story.
Yes, I do and I think anyone does.
My cousin met up with a strange old man who said he was a hot teen that she met online.
None come on my list, so I choose my neighbor's wife.
I have long black hair and I love it. My husband loves it too.
You care about your family and everyone in your family will love you.
Unattractive or overweight men simply take what they can get.
In the middle of the river while there were people watching it was actually pretty funny.
It is all in the eye contact.
It depends on the man, some men do and some men do not.
It gives us the impression that you may not have strong guts.
If you love him and he really loves you, he may want to upset his father.
Yes, some men get right down to it with absolutely no thought for the woman.
Maybe she is not attractive and the skinny chick was.
It does sound a little girlie.
If you want to enjoy a bit, why don't you check out some restaurants, night clubs, gyms, etc.
There are a lot of good women left. You just have to look in the right place.
It is like, everyone has to separate some day.
You win some and you lose some. Take it with a grain of salt and be more careful next time.
Happy birthday to you.
I just need someone to help me figure this out.
Pick the one with better treatment towards you.
I am also interested in a sixth grade boy.
If you end it, he might not be your friend. That is why I do not go with friends.
Stick yourself out there more, you have to do more than just make eye contact.
Do what is best for both of you.
Bad teeth, bad breath, and bad bo.
No one needs to know that.
If I am to ask, I will end the relationship and move on with my life.
Do not misunderstand me.
I asked him if he still liked me and he said yes, but he did not act like it.
Where am I going with this?
Keep getting her younger and younger guys. As one gets old, get a new one for her.
You know that is if you did not play the guilt trip.
That does not make it right, it means that it makes us human.
It is a mistake that cannot be undone.
Practice unwrapping starburst with your tongue and tying cherry stem with your tongue.
Did you catch her looking at you?
I know three men that I can probably get away with doing something like that.
Ask her out or tell her you like or admire her.
If he is going to be an on and off guy like that, I say break up with him.
If they do not, then you will have to move on with your life.
I have never been to it.
You should compliment her, ask her name, do not act strange, and act like you are the most attractive man ever.
She calls him constantly.
How should I approach her and be more than just another guy hitting on her?
Wait a little while, then date men that way you will enjoy it more.
Someone who is never "bitchy" just because she thinks it is cool. It is not.
It is because you do not have the power to decide what to do.
I know. Why should I hide it?
Some men do not like to dance.
She is not your friend because she will not stop bothering you.
I wish I had listened to my friends.
After how much time can you conclude that it takes too long and she is not really interested?
Do I want to be in love?
Why do they want to be married?
It is a no brainer. Also, a nice picture of George Clooney on your profile.
Some women cannot seem to find men their own age attractive.
Some do, but I would rather have a pair that were not too large.
It sounds like you are both comfortable with things the way they are.
It is very attractive and looks nice on most women.
Sometimes it is better to be very good friends first and make sure you are happy around each other.
Anyway, my question is, will I always feel that way?
Faith Hill's song "Love Ain't Like That" is a great example.
Please do not ask that question if you do not want your feelings hurt.
The girlfriend should accept that if she loves you.
I think it is very attractive when a man shaves his legs.
If you guys still keep in touch, I do not think that is the best thing to do.
I like this boy Austin, and I told my friend Claudia to ask him if he likes me.
You are killing the romance by asking such a stupid question. Have you ever considered having fun together instead?
He is a player, no good, trust me.
It depends, they all like different people, but not self-entitled freaks like you.
I think that is fantastic. Perhaps you should make the first move.
If he is not worth it, then he is not worth it.
You should just approach her.
It is a good idea to always be honest. Besides, not many guys I know like being told they are attractive.
They know the women will not chase them like good looking or wealthy men who get tons of women.
Just face him and say, "Hey, do you want to see a movie?"
That is why they call it making love.
Smile at him once in awhile and he will know.
Most girls are polite and will answer it.
I would. You sound a lot like my best friend.
Say, "Hey, when are you taking me to dinner?"
It really depends on the guy, but I think most guys do not care.
If you want it to work out, it will.
If he does not want to dance, then give it up.
However, you know what, I feel the guy should make the first move.
Without having a boyfriend, it would be a bit slutty.
Take it from a military girl, wait!
You never know, girls. They never show effect, only when they want something.
I am 49 years old and looking for a beautiful woman with whom to spend my time.
Do you mean to say, "Seem more sexy?"
If you go to deleted items, it should be there.
This is a red flag of how this guy is.
It may be because your name is freakgirl, but if you show your face, maybe not, no hard feelings.
That would be very painful. Trust me, I have been there and done that!
Do you love her deeply?
Have fun in jail asking that question to your cellmate.
No, the only time you see a man emotional is when he is with his lady love.
Yes, I have done it and it was a lot of fun.
You have to let the person you are with know what you want.
Of course, if she calls five times a day about that, then it would be crazy.
Hang in there for someone who appreciates you.
My mother books them all of the time. Pat@alanatvl.com
Besides, don't you think he has enough to worry about?
I have been dating a man who is younger than me.
Men play at love to get sex, women play at sex to get love.
It has got to get played out after a while.
Everybody likes to be told that they are attractive, even if they do not admit it.
Yes, but it depends on the man.
Perhaps because you think they look sexy when they are running on the feild.
You are too young to be talking about kissing already.
I will probably tell her soon because she is my best friend, but any help would be nice.
I agree with the other president before anyone gets hurt.
I am ready to move on, but I love him way too much.
Go out and do everything you couldn't do when you were with him or her.
Obviously, men are not much better.
What if you tell him that you just want to be friends with benefits?
You should play a truth or dare game together.
He sounds like a mean person.
Slow down the pace, perhaps, fourplay.
Death is like a big black bag full of crack, smack, or meth.
Practice kissing me. Where do you live?
No, you will not. I was married to a complete jerk.
It sounds like you really love her. There is no need to forget her.
Tell him that you are only interested in friends and that you are disappointed that he would act so unintelligent.
It always finds a way to get out in the open, just do not do it!
Also, what is with chest hair?
As of now, I think he is mad, hurt, upset, and got over you.
Give your brother some money and tell him to leave you alone.
No offense, but it sounds like a girls name, but no disrespect intended.
Be calm and ask her on a date.
Well, after you take her out, get to know her better, and then go for the kill and ask her out.
People do not like to be played around with.
Practice unraping starburst wrappers with your tongue. The girls love it!
I do not know. I just want the points.
That is not exactly true, it is just that most girls are discreet about it.
That depends on whether or not you are attractive with a body.
I told him it was too late. Other than that, I would not have minded getting flowers sometimes.
Believe in is a strange way to put it.
Why can men, or boys in your case, never say the word "love"?
Just enjoy the age you are and do not worry about all this.
Although I am 19, I like anything up to 30.
I had a friend in the same situation.
Girls are just as perverted, trust me.
You should not go out with a guy because you feel you need to.
Are you implying that she does not want to be more than a boyfriend and girlfriend?
Is it usually about a year before both people begin to feel comfortable in that comfortable, boring, stage?
Probably because I knew all the girlfriends were not really the one until I met my wife.
I think as long as you do not base your relationship on sex, it is okay.
Why would some men do that?
If you are the average guy, your breast size should not matter.
Stay away from men who cannot say that they like you.
Yes, ask for permission and watch how fast she hits you.
My husband likes me for me.
My mother also has cancer and this hits too close to home for me.
Be your best self. If he is impressed or likes you, he will talk back.
You do not want anyone else but that person ever.
Why don't you try chatting or seeing other guys just to catch his reaction?
However, it is acceptable to kiss on the first date.
Men have a problem with secrets.
I had someone get nasty with me because I was still dating.
How do I just kiss him?
I am the maid of honor for my only sister and I want it to be perfect.
Unless it is with the wrong man.
